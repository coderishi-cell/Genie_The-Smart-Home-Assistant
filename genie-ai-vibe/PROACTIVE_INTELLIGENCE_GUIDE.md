- **Dynamic Lighting**: Increases brightness during gloomy weather
- **Comfort Optimization**: Uses humidity and temperature data for optimal settings

### 3. **Time-Based Routines**
- **Morning Routine**: Automatically brightens lights and opens blinds
- **Evening Routine**: Sets warm lighting and activates security
- **Night Routine**: Dims lights, locks doors, and optimizes sleep temperature

### 4. **LLM-Powered Decision Making**
- **Intelligent Validation**: Uses Gemini AI to validate automation decisions
- **Context Understanding**: Considers current situation before making changes
- **Safe Automation**: Prevents unnecessary or disruptive actions

## 🔧 How It Works

### Learning Process
1. **Data Collection**: Every user interaction is logged with context
2. **Pattern Analysis**: System identifies recurring behaviors
3. **Prediction**: Uses patterns to predict future needs
4. **LLM Validation**: AI evaluates whether automation makes sense
5. **Execution**: Smart actions are performed automatically

### Decision Flow
```
User Behavior → Pattern Recognition → Weather Context → LLM Analysis → Smart Action
```
